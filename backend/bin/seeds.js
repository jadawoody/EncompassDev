      summary: "Infectious Disease has become an even more interesting specialty over the past year. But although COVID-19 is still a large topic for us, there are other subjects and advancements to review as well!",
      author: "Jada Woody",
      body1: "Infectious Disease! Most of us probably haven’t really given those two words a thought in the past few years – that is until COVID-19 hit every news channel, radio station, and the populations of almost every country in the world! Some of our young people, especially young children, may now think of COVID-19 as synonymous with Infectious Disease studies and medicine. Still, there are other facets of the Infectious Disease specialty that deserve recognition and attention – but today, we’re here to give some legitimate updates on the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      body2: "One thing we found important to note is that, according to the CDC, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths across the United States are still rising. This means that it isn’t yet safe to get back to our pre-2020 normal. Wearing a mask, distancing 6+ feet, and avoiding crowds are all great steps to help slow the spread of the disease. If we can slow the spread enough, we’ll all be able to help our amazing health care professionals and first responders to care for the sick and injured!",
      body3: "Next big ticket item…COVID-19 vaccines are now being administered! The CDC as well as your local health department will have information on where, when and how we all can get vaccinated! This is great news! With a working vaccine for COVID-19, we as a community may be able to return to a pre-pandemic normal much sooner. It also means that those who are vaccinated will have a much better chance of beating or fighting off the virus – should they be infected later on!",
      body4: "Now, although this vaccine is good news, we aren’t completely out of the woods just yet. Like we mentioned before, COVID-19 cases and deaths are still on the rise. So, there’s still reason for caution. Luckily, our medical director Dr. Bruce Ruben, along with our entire staff, have made a great effort to provide a safe and convenient place for patients to receive care, despite the pandemic and risk COVID-19 poses on us all. We have added to our sanitizing and social distancing routines here at the office, making sure to provide plenty of masks and hand sanitizers in the office for staff, patients, and visitors! We truly care about the safety of all parties in our office!",
      body5: "If you’re interested in learning more about these topics, we suggest you take a look at the source list we’ve provided. Below, you’ll find the website and articles we used to find factual information about the virus, pandemic, and the vaccine! ",

Vanderbilt's football team was faced with a difficult situation when over a dozen of their players tested positive for COVID-19. Vanderbilt's coaching staff asked Sarah Fuller, a member of the school's women's soccer team, to join them as their kicker for an upcoming game. And the rest is history!",
      author: "Jada Woody",
      body1: "The COVID-19 pandemic has raised complications across many aspects of our lives, causing us to make constant and sometimes unprecedented adjustments to our daily routines. As a nation and as a human race, we’ve all been dealt a similar hand this year – and the card we’ve all had in common is the risk of COVID-19. The way we separate ourselves is how we deal with this situation we are all in! Some of us have chosen to keep pushing though, to persevere, to stay positive, and this is such an incredible thing to see.",
      body2: "One example of this which has inspired us in particular is that of Vanderbilt University’s Football Program. What a show of leadership, perseverance, and determination! In case you hadn’t heard, Vanderbilt’s football team was recently faced with several players being infected with COVID-19 all at once, leaving them with a shortened roster and no kicker. They decided to ask a member of the Vanderbilt Women’s Soccer team, Sarah Fuller, to play as their kicker in games this season. And she said yes!",
      body3: "It’s important to note that Sarah Fuller is now the first female to ever play for a Power 5 college football team. Sarah is also just the third female to compete in the FBS, the highest level of college football. The other two athletes in this group were also kickers. Sarah Fuller has been named a Special Teams Player of the Week for her great performance in her first game with the Commodores. Congratulations Sarah Fuller! Way to persevere!",
      body4: "And to the Vanderbilt Football program, coaching staff, and entire team, way to persevere! We commend you on your refusal to quit, and your determination to find a way to get the job done! In such difficult times, it is important that we still do all we can and show ourselves and others that even in hardship or the face of adversity, we can still be great and have some fun along the way.",

      title: "How Telemedicine Might Be Enchancing the American Healthcare System",
      image: "images/telemedBlogDec2020.jpg",
      datePublished: "December, 2020",
      summary: "Curious as to how medical practices and facilities are changing due to the COVID-19 pandemic? Well, one sure change is the embrace of technology in medicine! Almost all healthcare providers are having to add more technology to the way they practice medicine. Let's talk about some of these new changes!",
      author: "Jada Woody",
      body1: "Since the start of technology being so mobile and active in our everyday lives, the American healthcare system has utilized it to enhance the patient experience. Mandy medical offices use tablets instead of clipboards and paper to check patients in, medical records are now kept in online databases instead of paper charts, patients check doctor’s websites for the hours and available services rather than making a phone call or stopping by. The use of technology in medicine started small, yes. But now we’re looking at an almost industry-wide embrace of technology for the safety of patients and staff! And this shift even has its own catchy name, telemedicine!",
      body2: "Chances are, you’ve heard the term telemedicine. Especially since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has become a very common term, describing the use of technology, phone calls, instant messaging, image sharing, or video calls to deliver medical consultation and care. It isn’t a tough concept to understand, but it’s changing the way we handle patient care.",
      body3: "Telemedicine is increasing the accessibility of physicians, specialists, and other healthcare professionals. Patients with disabilities, susceptible immune systems, or remote locations probably benefit the most from these technological advances, but in total, it seems to be improving the availability of care for all patients! Patients can now receive test results and imagery quicker than ever. The lab results or scans can be saved and sent via digital file and then interpreted by a medical physician over a phone call to the patient. Patient portals make medical records, bills, and past treatments accessible to patients 24/7.",
      body4: "One more recently popular addition to telemedicine is video conferencing between providers and patients. Patients who can’t make it into the office or hospital can video chat with their doctors, allowing them to feel more like they’re speaking face-to-face and allowing for more engagement than a phone call. During the COVID-19 pandemic, this feature has been very helpful for many physicians, healthcare providers, and especially for patients trying to limit exposure and risk. Patients who had tested positive for the virus were often asked to stay home and conduct their follow up appointments through telemedicine if they did not have to be hospitalized. Other patients who might have still been healthy, felt safer staying home than traveling to a doctors office where there might have been an opportunity for infection or exposure. Either way, providers offering telemedicine are helping mitigate risk.",
      body5: "Overall, we’ve found telemedicine to have a lot of positive changes. But like all change, there are always pros and cons. If you or someone you know has participated in telemedicine, either as the patient or the provider, let us know. We’re interested in how things are turning out and how all parties are adjusting to this new phase in healthcare. If you have questions about what services are available at Encompass HealthCare & Wound Medicine, you should contact our front desk or visit our website.",

      title: "Venous Insufficiency Can Be Cured at Encompass HealthCare!",
      image: "images/VeinBlogSept2020.jpg",
      datePublished: "September, 2020",
      summary: "Dr. Bruce E. Ruben, MD, our Medical Director walks through the basics of venous insufficiency and how we CURE these vein problems at Encompass HealthCare. By reading along with Dr. Ruben, you'll learn about Venous Ablation, a pain-free and minimally-invasive procedure we use to heal our patients!",
      author: "Bruce E. Ruben MD",
      body1: "Biological ablation is defined as the removal of a biological structure or functionality. Venous ablation, in particular, is a procedure used by physicians to shut down poorly performing veins that leak blood and fluids into the soft tissues of legs. Such leaking is the primary cause of chronic swelling, redness, heaviness, and sores that won’t heal.",
      body2: "Thus, ablation of just a few identified, culprit veins will reverse all of these symptoms and heal the long-standing sore. The methods that are available today for providing ablation of these veins are all minimally invasive and are performed in the physician’s office; however, patients should be aware that the level of pain associated with the procedure varies.",
      body3: "For example, the most painful ablation techniques use laser and radiofrequency, which “burns” the vein on the interior of the leg. In order to complete this specific technique, the introduction of multiple, separate injections of lidocaine filled fluid around the vein is required. As a result, the vein is ablated and the surrounding soft tissues are prevented from burning. OUCH! What’s worse, radiofrequency and laser procedures carry the risk of causing irreversible damage, and even accidental burning, to important sensory nerves; yet, with Clarivein, this is not a risk. In fact, we have seen that the benefits of the radiofrequency and laser procedures are present with Clarivein, but the risky outcomes are not.",
      body4: "Therefore, a lack of medical awareness is the only reason one would choose radiofrequency or laser procedures over the much less painful and risky Clarivein. At Encompass Healthcare we use Clarivein, a mechanical venous ablation procedure. This procedure typically requires no more than a single needle inserted into the targeted leg vein under ultrasound guidance, much like a typical lab draw at your doctors’ office. Guided by ultrasound, a catheter is threaded along the length of the interior vein and withdrawn while simultaneously creating a painless, inner vein injury in order to cause vein contraction, and thus ablation.",
      body5: "In general, venous ablation is a procedure which is considered only after other conservative measures have failed. Bruce Ruben, M.D., our Medical Director will often try compression bandaging like unna boots, pneumatic compression pumps, or multi-layer compression wrapping first. These methods are more akin to wrapping a leaking pipe with duct tape; however, it may just be enough to heal a non-healing wound without resorting to the vein ablation procedure. At Encompass Healthcare, each patient is always given the full range of appropriate options.",

      title: "Healthy Eating is the Key",
      image: "images/healthyEatBlogAug2020.jpg",
      datePublished: "August, 2020",
      summary: "One of the most important factors in a good healing regimen (after quality of care and patient compliance) is nutrition! Here, we'll talk about how important nutrition is to the healing process.",
      author: "Jada Woody",
      body1: "One of the most important factors in a good healing regimen after quality of care and patient compliance, is nutrition! We see lots of patients each day who are trying to heal a wound or burn, get rid of a nasty infection, or simply trying to get healthier overall, and one of the unfortunate things many of them have in common is poor nutrition. Most people don’t think about nutrition when they have an injury or wound.",
      body2: "Patients often think first about what they can do for their symptoms, their pain or discomfort, and what can be done about the injury itself. Should they wrap it? Cleanse it? Keep it try or moisturized? To they need medications or an x-ray? These are all valid thoughts and questions of course, but if a patient follows all of these steps and guidelines, and doesn’t have the right diet or daily nutrition, they may still have trouble healing! So here’s what we’ve found at Encompass HealthCare! A patient who is attempting to heal from a wound, injury, or infection, must have a well-balanced diet yes, but they may also need an increase in protein during the healing process!",
      body3: "Now, let’s address both sides of this statement. First, a well-balanced diet! What does this really mean? Well a dictionary definition would be that a well-balanced diet is one which gives the body the nutrients it needs to function correctly. Great! But we also have to recognize that the nutrients needed are actually different for each and every person. A seven year old girl does not need the same amount of proteins or fats or calories each day as a 28 year old NFL player does, right? So how do we know how much to eat of what? Well, there are lots of great resources on the internet that can tell you exactly how much of what kinds of foods you should be eating based on a number of factors like your sex, weight, height, age, activity level, allergies, etc. And some of these diet calculators can be extremely helpful.",
      body4: "But to put it simply, most individuals can follow these very basic guidelines; Nutrient Rich Food Groups:	Fresh Fruits, Fresh Vegetables, Lean Proteins, Whole Grains, Legumes & Nuts. These food groups offer a great variety of nutrients, including proteins and healthy fats and sugars. Do what you can to substitute these food groups in for less healthy alternatives like bacon, fried chicken, white bread, candied fruits, cookies, ice cream, pizza, cakes, energy drinks, sausages, etc. The more you can eat from the nutrient rich list instead of the unhealthy food items, the better off you will be.",
      body5: "Another important note in a well-balanced diet is the quantity of food you’re eating. Don’t overeat. Try going one week only eating when you actually feel hungry. Studies show that those who only eat when hungry actually enjoy food more, spend less at grocery stores and restaurants, feel healthier, and tend to lose excess body weight they may have had before. These are all great reasons to try it out! Now, the other side of nutrition that we talk to our patients about is “Nutrition While Healing”! This changes things a bit! While we still encourage our patients to keep a well-balanced diet, we also recommend that patients increase the intake of proteins when coming back from an injury or infection or when healing a wound.",
      body6: "This increase in protein helps the body gear up for the healing process and typically increases the speed at which patients heal. Proteins have a very important job in the body and in the healing process! There’s a good reason athletes use proteins for post-workout drinks and shakes! Proteins are responsible for the structure, function, and regulation of our tissues and organs. Including muscles, bones, skin, and much more. Your body needs protein to help repair any damage done to the body.",
      body7: "And if there is a significant amount of damage, say a third degree burn over the forearm, the body will need more protein than normal to complete the task of repairing the tissues! Hence, our guideline for increased protein intake during the healing process! We hope this message was helpful to you! Be sure to pass it along, we all can use a healthful tip once in a while! Remember, a balanced diet will not only help you heal, but also can keep you from getting injured or becoming sick! Stay healthy friends!",

That is why Dr. Ruben, our medical director, has introduced two therapy dogs into our office! Inky and Pocket bring a sense of joy to our office each and every day! Many of our patients have attested to the calming affect the dogs have had on them and tell us they look forward to visiting the dogs at each appointment in our office.",
      body2: "Inky and Pocket have been nicknamed the Wound Dogs because of how quickly some of our patients have healed when they’ve spent extended time with the dogs. Many patients tell us how the Wound Dogs have lifted their spirits and given them the positive mindset they needed in order to heal! Pet therapy is so powerful! We believe in the affect a healthy, happy pet can have on a person’s mental health and their healing experience in general! It follows along closely with Dr. Ruben’s philosophy of treating the WHOLE PATIENT, not just the hole in the patient!",

      author: "Jada Woody",
      body1: "Did you know? Dr. Ruben offers Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) at Encompass HealthCare! Yep, that’s right. We’ve been treating patients with HBOT for years and it has done wonders for so many of them! Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy uses a special chamber, pressurized with 100% pure oxygen to get high levels of oxygen into the body.",
      body2: "When utilized as a medical therapy, oxygen in high doses can help heal bone infections, chronic wounds, brain abscesses, and radiation damaged soft tissue. Typically, a patient would have to visit a hospital or a major medical facility in order to receive this treatment. This can be problematic. A patient who is already at risk, due to infections, tissue damage, or open wounds, should be staying out of hospitals, due to the significantly increased risk of a Healthcare Acquired Infection (HAI).",
      body3: "Now, thanks to Dr. Ruben’s expertise and implementation of three individual hyperbaric chambers in our office, we are able to offer the treatment in a much safer environment that fits into our patients’ daily schedules. The three hyperbaric chambers we utilize in our office are called monoplace chambers, which allow for a patient to receive treatment in their own space, without having to share the chamber with others. All chambers are in view of their own tv so that the patient has some entertainment during their treatment. Our monoplace chambers ensure that each patient gets individualized attention from our hyperbaric technician who is in the room and available via both sight and intercom during the entire “dive”.",
      body4: "Dr. Ruben uses the list of medical conditions that are indicated and approved by the US FDA for treatment with Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy. This ensures that all use of HBOT in our office is both safe and ethical! Here are some of the more common conditions from that list: -	Severe Burn Injury -	Non-healing Wounds -	Arterial Insufficiencies -	Radiation Tissue Damage -	Intracranial Abscess -	Bone Infection .
